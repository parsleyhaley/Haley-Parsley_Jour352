        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3><strong> Investigative Fellow </strong></h3>
        <h4>Howard Center for Investigative Journalism - University of Maryland</h4>
        <h5>2024-Present</h5>
        <p>
            I research public records and interview sources in support of long-term investigative projects, including an
            ongoing investigation into freight rail safety and the movement of hazardous materials. I am currently
            leading a team of five writers to produce a story for Howard Center’s spring 2025 investigation.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Legal Investigator</strong></h3>
        <h4>Brancart & Brancart</h4>
        <h5>2021-2024</h5>
        <p>
            I led investigations at a small civil rights law firm by collecting public records, accessing census data,
            conducting intake interviews, gathering background material, and locating witnesses. I also analyzed
            evidence to prepare accurate and compelling legal documents, including complaints, discovery requests, and
            motions. My responsibilities also included managing case files to ensure that deadlines were met and
            evidence was easily accessible. I interfaced with clients and attorneys to conduct investigations, gather
            materials, and provide case updates. Additionally, I served as a trial assistant for two federal court cases
            (Ohio House v. City of Costa Mesa and Torres v. Rothstein).
