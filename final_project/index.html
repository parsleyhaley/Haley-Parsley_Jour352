                    <p>On July 5, 2024, Kevin Wolsky’s day began with a call from his local sheriff.</p>

                    <p>
                        It was around 5:30 a.m. when the North Dakota farmer picked up the phone. “We had a derailment,”
                        he remembers the sheriff saying. “I need to know if your mother or anyone is home.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Wolsky is the third generation to run his family’s farm, which sits about 300 yards from a
                        railroad line that cuts across southern North Dakota. He no longer lives on the farm, but his
                        mother does.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Concerned for her safety, Wolsky jumped in his truck and raced over to the house. Within half an
                        hour, he stood before the first train derailment Bordulac had seen since 1989. “It had flames
                        three stories tall,” he said, during a phone interview.

                        Wolsky would later learn that at around 3:30 that morning, a freight train run by the Canadian
                        Pacific Kansas City Railroad had derailed while passing over a creek near Wolsky’s farm, in the
                        small town of Bordulac.

                    <p>
                        The force of impact caused the cars to slam into each other and yank and twist against their
                        couplers. Twenty-nine cars from the train jumped the track, some toppling over on their sides,
                        according to the National Transportation Safety Board, a federal agency that investigates
                        commercial transportation accidents. At least nine tank cars carrying hazardous materials were
                        torn apart or punctured, and various pieces of equipment were shorn off their sides. The
                        contents of the cars, methanol and anhydrous ammonia, almost immediately began seeping into the
                        surrounding land.

                        Methanol and anhydrous ammonia are considered highly flammable chemicals; methanol is a liquid
                        and anhydrous ammonia is a gas. As the methanol pooled beneath the derailment, it was heated by
                        the train and quickly ignited. As the flames grew they heated the anhydrous ammonia, which also
                        began to burn. The fallen tank cars that had not been compromised began to heat, creating
                        internal pressure. Soon, nine other cars had failed, adding their contents to the toxic pools
                        around them and feeding the fire.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Wolsky was able to help his mother to safety, and she remained evacuated from her home for two
                        days before returning, after the fire had subsided. None were injured, and surrounding farms
                        were not damaged, in part, resident Doug Zink said, because the wind blew the smoke and fire
                        South of the derailment.

                    <p>
                        A new investigation by the Howard Center revealed that the derailment could have been far more
                        devastating, had conditions been different that day.

                        Railroads are not required to provide the public with information about the hazardous materials
                        they carry, even if those materials travel through regular people’s backyards every day. After a
                        derailment, railroads are only required to provide information about the contents of the train
                        that were released during the accident. The full makeup of the train—called the consist—is
                        rarely made public. Following the derailment in Bordulac, CPKC reported that, the twenty-nine
                        derailed cars, 17 were transporting hazardous materials.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, data provided to the Howard Center by RailState, a private company that uses sensors to
                        collect detailed information about the movement of freight trains and their cargo, shows that
                        the full consist included at least 51 cars loaded with the most dangerous, and most flammable,
                        hazardous materials, including liquified petroleum gas and ethanol.

                        such as crude oil and ethanol, could ignite and cause catastrophic damage.</q

                    <p>
                        At least one of the derailed cars was a model widely considered by safety experts to be unsafe
                        for use transporting flammable hazardous materials like methanol and anhydrous ammonia. In a
                        2015 report, the NTSB said that the tank cars’ weak design, “create[s] the risk that, in an
                        accident, hazardous materials could be released and, in the case of flammable liquids such as
                        crude oil and ethanol, could ignite and cause catastrophic damage.”

                    <p>
                        >In 2015, the FAST Act required that DOT-111 tank cars be phased-out for use carrying certain
                        types of hazardous materials, including crude oil and ethanol, dangerous gasses, and flammable
                        liquids. DOT-111 cars must be replaced, the law states, by a newer, reinforced model, known as
                        the DOT-117. The FAST ACT introduced a phase-out schedule that is staggered by material. Most of
                        the deadlines have passed, but one is remaining: a May 2029 deadline for the phase-out of
                        DOT-111 cars and their replacement with DOT-117 cars.

                    <p>
                        Safety officials, including the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, believe
                        that this deadline is too late, and that it would be feasible for the tank car industry to
                        complete the phase-out more quickly.

                        Tank car owners and shippers should carefully and closely consider whether their decisions place
                        financial considerations ahead of safety and protection of human lives and the environment.</q

                    <p>
                        In 2023, PHMSA put out an advisory urging tank car owners and chemical shippers to stop using
                        DOT-111 cars. “Tank car owners and shippers should carefully and closely consider whether their
                        decisions place financial considerations ahead of safety and protection of human lives and the
                        environment.”

                        But those financial considerations are often more compelling to shippers that PHMSA’s pleas,
                        according to Paul Stancil, an NTSB investigator who helped develop the safer DOT-117 model. “A
                        lot of the pushback that has occurred here comes from shippers or fleet owners who are looking
                        at it from an economic viewpoint,” he said, during an interview in March. “Several have
                        financial interest in large fleets of these, I'll call substandard tank cars, and they're trying
                        to maximize the return on their investments.”
